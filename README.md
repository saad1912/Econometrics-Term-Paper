### Abstract
This report endeavors to explore the influence of household attitudes towards dowry on the highest level of education achieved by females. It draws upon data from the India Human Development Survey (IHDS) 2011, a nationally representative, comprehensive survey covering 42,152 households in 1,420 villages and 1,042 urban neighborhoods across India.
The study concludes that, even after accounting for relevant factors, positive attitudes towards dowry correlate with higher levels of female education attainment. Furthermore, the study asserts the robustness of its findings.
